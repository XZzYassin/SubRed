## SublimeText Redmine Client

SublimeText Plugin to interact with Redmine right in your editor.

### Quick Start
- Clone/download plugin to your SublimeText User folder under SubRed

### Configure

Set the `redmine_url` and `api_key` in `Preferences: Package Settings > SublimeCombineMediaQueries > Settings â€“ User`:

```
{
  "redmine_url" : "URL to your Redmine",
  "api_key": "Set your Redmine API Key"
}
```

### Functions

##### 1. View Redmine Issue right in you SublimeText view pane.
Hit 'shift+command+k"' and enter Issue ID:

![Search for issue](screenshots/search_id.png?raw=true)

New view will open for each issue you search:
![Issue served](screenshots/issue.png?raw=true)

### Why?

I really hate to open browser, navigate to Redmine and look for issue when I need only to take a look on it.

### Found error or want more?

  - Use Issues button
  - Fork -> Add magic -> Pull Request
